# ISW_21cm
This program is a part of Master research advised by Prof. Marilena Loverde at Stony Brook University. The goal of this program is constraning cosmological parameters by Fisher analysis using the cross-correlation functions of Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations.

# Before running codes
1. 'default' in /source/path.py should be changed to be a path of 'ISW_21cm' folder in the machine.
2. Should do 'make' in both 'class_syn' and 'class_new' folder.
