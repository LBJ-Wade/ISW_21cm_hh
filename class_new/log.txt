Computing background
 -> ncdm species i=1 sampled with 11 (resp. 11) points for purpose of background (resp. perturbation) integration. In the relativistic limit it gives Delta N_eff = 1.0132
 -> total N_eff = 3.046 (sumed over ultra-relativistic and ncdm species)
 -> non-cold dark matter species with i=1 has m_i = 6.000000e-02 eV (so m_i / omega_i =9.313858e+01 eV)
 -> age = 13.832340 Gyr
 -> conformal age = 14181.692658 Mpc
